# Computer Programming 2 - Course Portfolio (A.Y. 2024-2025)

This repository contains a compilation of programming activities completed for the course **Computer Programming 2 (CP102)** at **Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation** during the academic year 2024–2025.

All programs are written in **Python** and are organized according to the course outcomes. Each directory corresponds to a specific learning objective, with activities and term outputs designed to meet that outcome.

## Repository Structure
- Activities 1-5: Programming exercises for each unit.
- Prelim Output: Initial term project submissions.
- Midterm Output: Mid-semester projects.
- Semi-Final Output: Projects towards the semester’s end.
- Final Output: The culminating project for the course.

> **Note:** The Final Output is a standalone Birthday Tracker application built with Python, SQLite, and PyQt6.  
> You can find the dedicated repository for this project [here](https://github.com/neophiles/Birthday-Tracker-Application.git).

## Course Outcomes
1. Create Python program applying object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. Use regular expression to search pattern in a string.
3. Create a Python program that performs data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.
4. Create Python program that performs create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations in a database using Structured Query Language (SQL).
5. Create a Python program with graphical user interface (GUI).

## Credits
- Professor Rodrigo C. Belleza Jr., Dean of the College of Computing and Multimedia Studies and Associate Professor V, for his guidance, expertise, and support throughout this course.
